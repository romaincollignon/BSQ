## :rocket: Introduction

    You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.
    The board is represented by a file passed as the programâ€™s argument,
    respecting those constraints:

     â€¢ its first line contains the number of lines on
     the board (and only that),
     â€¢ "." (representing an empty place) and "o"  (representing an obstacle) are the
     only two allowed characters for the other lines,
     â€¢ all of the lines will be the same length (except the first one),
     â€¢ there will always be at least one line,
     â€¢ each line is terminated by â€™\nâ€™. You program must print the board, with some
     "." replaced by "x" to represent the largest square you found.
